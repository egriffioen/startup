## GitHub Tutorial
Useful git commands
`git clone urlofrepository` clones a repositiory to your computer
`git add file.txt` adds a file to be staged
`git commit -m "commit message"` commits the staged files with a message describing the change
`git push` pushes those commits to GitHub
`git pull` pulls down any changes from GitHub to your files
`git fetch` get info on changes on GitHub without changing local repo
`git status` see the difference between your clone and GitHub, will help us see if we are missing a commit

A merge conflict will happen if the same line of code is edited on 2 different ends and those changes are commited.
